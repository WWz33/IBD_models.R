### LANDSCAPE GENOMICS PIPELINE IN R ###
### PART 2 - ISOLATION BY DISTANCE AND FINE-SCALE SPATIAL GENETIC STRUCTURE ###


Scripts in R for 4 different analyses using SNPS, VCF, or Genind objects.

Isolation by Distance (IBD):
1. MANTEL TESTS - Classical IBD Tests
2. PROCRUSTES ANALYSES - Association between Geography and Genetics matrices
3. LOESS - LOESS model to indicate where individuals are more related to each other in the study area than the expected by chance
4. sPCA - Compare allelic frequency of individuals to their neighbours and plot it in a map
5. EEMS - Spatial population structure with EEMS - Estimated Effective Migration Surfaces
